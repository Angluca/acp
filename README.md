ACP
---

ACP is a fork of autocomplpop 2.14.1. I liked the auto-completion feature and
preferred the much simpler code of autocomplpop to neocomplcache. But it seemed
like it was no longer supported and was structured in a monolithic way that
made it harder to extend.

So this fork is to provide continued support and to refactor the code to make
it easier to extend.
